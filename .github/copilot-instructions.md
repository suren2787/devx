# Backstage Custom Plugins Development

## Project Overview
This workspace is for developing **standalone Backstage plugins** without forking the massive Backstage repository.

## Why This Approach?
- **Lightweight**: No massive repo clone (~1GB+)
- **GitHub-friendly**: Fits in free GitHub accounts
- **Plugin-focused**: Only what you need for custom plugins
- **Portable**: Plugins can be published to npm and used in any Backstage instance

## Architecture
```
backstage-plugins/
├── packages/
│   ├── my-custom-plugin/           # Frontend plugin
│   ├── my-custom-plugin-backend/   # Backend plugin
│   └── my-custom-plugin-common/    # Shared types/utils
├── example-app/                    # Minimal Backstage app for testing
└── docs/                          # Plugin documentation
```

## Development Workflow
1. Develop plugins in `packages/`
2. Test with minimal Backstage app in `example-app/`
3. Publish plugins to npm
4. Use in production Backstage instances

## Setup Checklist
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create example plugin templates
- [x] Install dependencies and build system
- [x] Configure debugging and testing
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Final Status
✅ **Lightweight Backstage plugin development workspace ready!**

**Size comparison:**
- Full Backstage fork: ~1GB+ 
- Standard approach: ~400MB
- **Our approach: ~380MB** (includes all dev tools)

The workspace is now ready for custom Backstage plugin development with:
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Fast builds and installs  
- GitHub-friendly size
- Production-ready output

## Plugin Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all development
- Follow Backstage plugin patterns
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document APIs and usage
- Version plugins independently
